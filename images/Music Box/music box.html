    <h1>Music Box</h1>
    <p>The first thing I did was to set parameters so that if I need to change the size and measurement of the box along the 3D designing process, it would be much easier. I set parameters for the length (x), width (Y), height (Height), as well as the thickness of the wood (THK). The wood I'm using is 3mm thick. I also set parameters for the number of tabs I intended there to be on the sides of the pieces so that I can change them if I want to and also make it easier for me to figure out the length of the tabs and spaces in between.</p>

    <p>I started with the base of the box. I created a sketch of a rectangle using the parameters I set for length and width. Then, I extruded it by 3mm and created another sketch for the tabs. I wanted 5 tabs along the length of the base and 3 tabs along the width. So I sketched 2 rectangles with a width of 3mm, or THK, and set the length as 'x/tabs5'. This would automatically ensure that every tab is the same length. I did the same with all of the sketch dimensions of each tab. Then I selected the tabs I wanted to cut and extruded them away.</p>

    <p>Now that my base had tabs along one side, I created another sketch for the back of the box. Again, I used the parameters, this time for the length and height to create a rectangle. Then I extruded it and used the base as a tool to cut the tabs into the back piece.</p>

    <p>I created tabs on the sides of the back piece using the parameters and extruded them away, completing my back piece.</p>

    <p>Since the front piece is the same as the back piece except for the latch, I just copied and moved it to where I wanted the front to be positioned using the 'point to point' function. I then used the front piece to cut tabs into the base piece. For the latch on the front piece, I initially wanted a sort of semicircle piece that could be lifted up... but I eventually realised that the laser cutter machine wouldn't be able to do what I wanted so I discarded the idea and changed it to a simple rectangular tab. For both versions, I created a sketch of the tab/latch that I wanted on the top piece, extruded it, and used it to cut into the front piece.</p>

    <p>The top piece was just a rectangle measuring 50mm by 40 mm (the length/width of the box with the thickness of the pieces on both sides subtracted away). I designed a pattern on Adobe Illustrator and imported it into Fusion 360 in svg format, positioned it to where I wanted it to be on the top piece and extruded the design away since I wanted the design to be cut into the wood instead of engraved.</p>

    <p>I followed the same process of creating the right piece as when I created the base piece. However, I also had to design a mechanism for a hinge so that the top could be lifted. To do this, I sketched out two circles, with a diameter of 5mm and 8mm respectively, then extruded the pieces I needed out. Then I copied and moved the right piece to where the left piece would be. I also made sure that all the tabs were cut on every piece.</p>

    <p>To create a hinge for the top piece, I created two new tabs on both sides of the top piece that would fit into the hole in the side pieces.</p>

    <p>Thus, I completed the 3D design for my music box!</p>

    <p>I had to export every piece as a dxf, import it into Adobe Illutrator and double check the measurements to make sure that it was the same as in Fusion 360. Once the measurements were correct, I could already print them out with the laser cutter machine. However, I also wanted an engraving of my initials to be on the base of the box, so I designed it in Adobe Illustrator again and moved it to where I wanted it to be on the base piece.</p>

    <p>I exported everything as an svg, and configured it in CorelDraw. Then I sent it to the laser cutter to be printed. You might have noticed that I didn't include a hole for the handle of the music box to fit in. That's because I was afraid my measurements would be off and the handle wouldn't be able to fit into the hole, especially since I designed my box to be pretty compact so the mechanism for the actual music would fit inside as snugly as possible. So after all my pieces were printed, I compared the pieces with the mechanism and marked where the hole would go, then manually drilled a hole into the right piece so that the handle would fit in perfectly. Here are the finished pieces!</p>
