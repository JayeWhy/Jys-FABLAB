<p>Alrighty. There's quite a lot going on here so I'm going to seperate everything into sections to make it clearer. For my final project, I am attempting to make an automatic flour sifter, because baking is a hobby I enjoy and do quite often. However, I find it frustrating and time consuming sometimes to sift the flour (it's best to sift flour to avoid lumps) so I took this opportunity to try to create a machine that will do it for me.</p>
<p>The design will be a body in the middle with a an open centre that holds the sift up and allows it to do it's thing. There'll also be another body that would move the body in the middle back and forth in order to sift the flour. This body would include handles so I can hold it up while sifting. Let's begin.</p>
    <h3 id="#3D-Print">3D Print</h3>
<p>I'm going to start off by creating my 3D design. First I measured the sift I usually use, and design in according to the dimensions so that the sift can sit in the middle of the structure, and be held up by the brim. I started by creating a bunch of circles according to the dimensions to make the body. I then extruded it to 55mm for the walls of the body.</p>

<p>I created another sketch and revolved it around the centre axis so that it would form the brim, and hold up the sift in the middle and joined them.</p>

<p>This formed the basic foundation of the body that would hold the sift. I also needed tabs on the bottom of it for it to fit into a base I plan to have laser cut, however I'm going to leave them for later and just use the base to cut them in. Next, I moved on to the mechanism that would move the sift back and forth. Because I'm using servo motors as my machinery, it can only rotate so I need something to change that to a back and forwards motion. To do this I'm going to create a gear and accompanying gear rack. Since those are very finicky to create, (because they need to be even and hand-drawn lines or images taken from the internet don't really do the trick) I took a shortcut and instead inserted a 'McMaster-Carr Component'. I simply searched for a suitable gear and gear rack that suited my needs (something that sounds a lot simpler than it actually is) and inserted it into Fusion360 as a new component. Then I did what adjustments I needed (shortening, ect.) and copied it so I had two. Then I joined the gear rack to the body, which turned out to be a very bad idea I would regret immensely when I spent hours atempting to remove the supports from it.</p>

<p>I also had to create a hole where the gear could go through and leave space for the body to move. Halfway along my design, I had a mini existential crisis of HOW THE THING IN THE MIDDLE IS SUPPOSED TO BE FLOATY AND STAY UP, which I eventually resolved by coming up with the idea of supports that the body in the middle could slide along, and be held up by the outer body. It was the simplest solution that came to mind at the moment. It would have been more ideal if there was a wheel or track along which it could slide along on, but in lieu of that I... innovated...</p>
<p>Then, just when I thought everything was essentially completed, I had another existential crisis when I realised that my deisgn was way too big for the printer, which led to me doing <i>math</i> at 1am in the middle of the night trying to figure a way to split it as little as possible and still have it fit. This entire project is basically a record of my incresing anxiety and blood pressure. Splitting it in the 3 was still too big, which meant I wasted a good chunk of my time trying to remember trigonometry, and I eventually caved and decided to split it into 4 instead.</p>

<p>But now that my centre body is as done as I have the patience for, it's time to move on to my other nightmareâ€”I mean body.</p>
